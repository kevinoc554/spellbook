# SpellBook
## Project Goals
SpellBook is intended a resource for players of the tabletop role playing game, Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), published by Wizards of the Coast (Wizards).

SpellBook offers a quick, simple and interactive way for players to look up the  Spells associated with the different D&D classes, and to examine the game rules for each Spell in detail.

- Players may use this site while actually playing with other people, and as such need to be able to find the information in a timely, straightforward manner to minimize disruption to the game.

- Provide a streamlined, interactive interface that users can navigate easily and quickly to find the information they need.
