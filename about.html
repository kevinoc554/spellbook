                    <p class="about-text">SpellBook is a quick, simple and interactive way for players to look up the
                        Spells associated
                        with the different Dungeons & Dragons classes, and
                        to examine the game rules for each Spell in detail.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">SpellBook allows users to search by player Class, and see the full list of
                        spells associated with
                        each Class presented as an interactive table. Users can order this Spell List by Level, Spell
                        Name or the School with which the spell is associated. Users looking for a
                        particular spell can type their query into a search bar to filter the spell list further.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">When a user clicks on an entry in the Spell List, the Spell Info section will
                        update with the full information for that spell. Users will be able to see the spell's level,
                        casting time, and range, along with a full description of the spell's effects. Further details
                        regarding the spell's components and damage dealt at higher levels can be found by interacting
                        with relevant sections.</p>
